# community-archives-plugin.github.io

The Community & Family Archives plugin converts Wordpress into a system to capture and catalog the narratives, objects, and documents of the history of a particular local community or family. 

The Community archives component of this project means that the community itself will participate in structuring the archive by way of the objects, stories, and metadata they provide through the web interface. 

The Community & Family Archives plugin turns Wordpress into a system that collects, manages, catalogs, and preserves information about people and places and the important objects of a collection. 

The Community & Family Archives plugin can be used to inventory a collection objects. In this sense, it is a minimal “Collections Management Tool” or a “Library Catalog” or an “Archive Finding Aid.” As such, the system can output a list or catalog of all items that are entered. 

The Community & Family Archives plugin is also meant to capture informal oral and written histories as told by members of the community or family that is being documented. Those who are granted permissions and roles can log in and be presented with a set of objects or topics, and can describe them by typing into a text box. 

The Community & Family Archives plugin is meant to be run independently on a server and web domain that is owned by the constituents/principals of the family or community itself. The software is free and will continue to be developed and supported by the open source community. 

The Community & Family Archives plugin addresses the complex needs of small, local historical and preservation efforts in a way that can scale up to a full academic institutional repository but in a format that is small enough and with a user interface that is friendly enough that archivists without formal LIS training can easily access it. 

Features: 
-Complex user roles and access privileges: data entered is automatically private and only viewable to the user themselves, by default. 
-Documents, objects, statements, stories, and information can all be “hidden” from individuals or groups. This can be permanent or for a duration, such as “for 50 years.” 
-Community/Family members who are entering information see a minimal interface that is simple to use and that facilitates oral/written histories. 
-Relationship language can dynamically conform to the individual who is logged in: i.e. your son, your grandmother, your daughter’s oldest son. 
-Administrators can set up the primary names, locations, and relationships that the archive documents, and can manage this as metadata and as user roles. 
—configuring this allows the system to be adapted to the language, cultures, and customs of a family or community. 
-Records that are created in an account can be “submitted” to the archive, or not. They can include some but not all information. 
-Administrators can also designate “fact” statements with attributions. These can relate to a timeline of events and time periods that are being documented. 
-Administrators can identify relevant historical periods, historical figures, historical events, and famous nouns as being related to this archive. 
-Researchers can add metadata to the materials and narratives that members submit. 
-Researchers can publish articles and collections that highlight the information that the archive provides. 
-Robust support for academic references and document/newspaper references that are important to researchers. 
-Robust support for cultural heritage materials, photographs, documents, rare books and manuscripts, contemporary film and video multimedia 
-Ability to view timelines and family trees. 

Metadata Support 
-The system uses Wordpress’s built-in Taxonomy capabilities in order to offer robust support for taxonomies including community folksonomies. 
-The system works with and encourages the use of standardized and controlled vocabularies, including the creation of thesauri. All data entered can be exported to Dublin Core XML records. 
-An interface allows for the configuration and maintenance of controlled vocabularies. 

Development: 
The Community & Family Archives plugin is built atop the most popular and best supported open source content management system and plugins. By building on the Wordpress core and several of Wordpress’s most popular extensions, we can accomplish the following: 
-make use of a mature, well-supported, open-source, well-document web-based content management system, which can freely be installed on any self-hosted domain. 
-make use of mature, well-supported, open-source, well-documented Wordpress plugins that accomplish as much of the goals stated above as possible, with as little customization as possible. 
-focus on a system that uses future-proof, regularly-updated modern web standards for accessibility, security, speed, and user interface best practices. 
-take part in the open source movement for the preservation of cultural heritage.
